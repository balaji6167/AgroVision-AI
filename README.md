# 🌾 AgroVision – Intelligent Agriculture Platform

AgroVision is a full-stack, AI-powered agricultural decision-support system designed to help farmers make smarter, data-driven choices. Unlike traditional systems that only provide results, AgroVision explains *why* a recommendation is made — enabling users to learn and trust the system.

## 🌟 Key Features

* 🌱 **Crop Recommendation System**
  Suggests the most suitable crop based on environmental and soil conditions.

* 🧪 **Fertilizer Recommendation**
  Identifies nutrient deficiencies and recommends appropriate fertilizers.

* 🌾 **Yield Prediction**
  Estimates crop yield (tons per hectare) using machine learning.

* 🌿 **Plant Disease Detection**
  Uses deep learning to analyze plant leaf images and detect diseases.

* 🌦 **Real-time Weather Data**
  Fetches live weather information to improve predictions.

* 🧠 **Explainable AI (XAI)**
  Provides human-readable explanations for every recommendation.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Smart Input System

Farmers often don't have access to technical soil data (N, P, K levels).
To solve this, AgroVision uses a **Soil Mapping System**:

* User selects soil type (e.g., Red Soil, Black Soil)
* Backend estimates NPK values automatically
* These values are used as input for ML models

---

### 2️⃣ AI Recommendation Engine

**Input Parameters:**

* Soil Type
* pH Level
* Rainfall
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Season

**Process:**

* A trained Random Forest model (2200+ real-world records) predicts the best crop

**Output:**

* Recommended crop
* Confidence score
* Detailed explanation

---

### 📝 Sample Input & Output

**Input:**

* Soil Type: Black Cotton Soil
* Rainfall: 1000 mm
* Temperature: 25°C
* Season: Kharif

**Output:**

* ✅ Crop: Cotton
* 📊 Confidence: 98.5%
* 💡 Explanation:
  Based on high water retention and estimated NPK levels (N:70, P:60, K:40), cotton is ideal for monsoon conditions.
